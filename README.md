📚 Virtual Research Assistant — Agentic AI using AutoGen

An intelligent multi-agent system powered by AutoGen that automatically reads, analyzes, and summarizes top research papers on Agentic AI.
This project showcases how LLM-driven agents can collaborate to perform deep literature analysis — extracting purpose, key contributions, advantages, disadvantages, and future research directions from each paper.

🚀 Features
🤖 Multi-Agent Collaboration — Uses AutoGen agents (Reader, Summarizer, Critic, Comparator) to coordinate complex research tasks.
📄 Automated Research Summaries — Generates structured summaries of academic papers with purpose, findings, and pros/cons.
🧠 Agentic AI Framework — Demonstrates concepts of LLM-Agents, MLLM-Agents, and multi-agent orchestration.
🗂️ Organized Output — Presents research insights in a clean, categorized format for each paper.
🔍 Scalable Design — Easily extendable to new topics beyond Agentic AI.
🏗️ Tech Stack
Python 3.11
AutoGen — for agent creation and orchestration
GROQ API Key — for reasoning and summarization
